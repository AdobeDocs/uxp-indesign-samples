# Introduction / Topic heading
<!-- Introduce the plugin sample/starter. Explain what it's meant to do. Enlist a few use cases.  -->

<!-- For example, "Create plugin panels, or dialog modals using these UXP UI components. Find the examples of Spectrum Widgets available." -->

## Compatibility
<!-- Mention the minimum version of UXP and host application that is required. -->
Since InDesign v18.5 and UXP v7.0.


<!-- Also mention, if the topic is relevant for scripts. Keep in mind that scripts have fixed manifest permissions. 
For example, "You may also use these UI controls to build a modal dialog for scripts written in UXP."   -->

## Documentation

<!-- Provide reference to
1. concepts, 
2. tutorials/recipes, 
3. APIs etc on the devsite that are associated to this topic -->


## Getting started
<!-- Quick steps to get the plugin up and running. Concentrate on npm/yarn commands.

For example, for plugins that have node dependencies

### Pre-requisites

You need
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en_) vX.x or higher to build the plugin
2. [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
2. UXP Developer Tool (UXP) //TODO Link to UDT docs


Follow the steps to build the plugin:
1. `yarn install` to install all dependencies
2. `yarn build` to build the project. Observe the creation of `/dist` folder after this step.
3. (optional)`yarn watch` to automatically build the project every time you update a source file. Observe the creation of `/dist` folder after this step.
3. `yarn start` to keep the plugin running and automatically build after every change.

Load the plugin into the application via UDT
1. Make sure the application is running and you can see it under 'Connected apps'
2. Click on 'Add Plugin' button and select the `manifest.json` of this plugin.
3. (optional) Configure the `dist` folder of your plugin by using 'More' -> 'Advanced' option from the action menu `•••`
4. Click on the ••• menu on the corresponding plugin row. Select 'Load' to view the plugin inside your application.
5. (optional) Select 'Watch' from plugin actions ••• to dynamically load the latest plugin changes. Note that a manifest change would need you to 'Unload' and 'Load' the plugin from scratch.

(if applicable) Attach screenshot of loaded plugin in the app. -->

## Deep dive
<!-- Add details, explanation of code to educate the developer. For example, a specific flag or version of manifest.json, troubleshooting tips, etc -->
